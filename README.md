🔢🔥 Hot & Cold Number Guessing Game - My First Year Engineering Project! ❄️🎮

Back in my 1st year of engineering, I wanted to build something fun yet logical, so I created a Hot & Cold Number Guessing Game in Python! 🎯

💡 How it Works:
👉 The program picks a random number between 1 and 100.
👉 If your guess is within ±10, you're HOT! 🔥 (close to the answer).
👉 If you're more than 10 away, you're COLD! ❄️ (far from the answer).
👉 The game keeps going until you guess the correct number!

This small project helped me understand loops, conditionals, and user interaction in Python while making coding fun! 🚀

I believe every big journey starts with small steps, and this game was one of my first! Looking back, it reminds me how much I've grown as a developer and problem solver.
